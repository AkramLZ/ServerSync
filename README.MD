## What is ServerSync?
ServerSync is an innovative plugin crafted to facilitate the real-time synchronization of your Spigot servers with your
proxy servers, supporting BungeeCord and Velocity. It dispenses with the necessity for manual adjustments and system
reboots by automatically managing the registration and un-registration of Spigot servers on the proxy side.

This plugin **REQUIRES** a message broker, currently supporting [Redis](https://redis.io/) only, RabbitMQ will be
implemented later.

## Installation
### For BungeeCord/Waterfall
1. Drop `serversync-bungee.jar` file in your BungeeCord plugins folder.
2. Start the server to generate configuration file, it will be located in `plugins/ServerSync/config.yml`
3. Stop the server.
4. Go to ServerSync configuration file and configure message broker credentials.
5. Once you finish, start your server again and congratulations! you finished configuring it in proxy side.
### For Velocity
It's the same as BungeeCord, but with minor differences:
1. Drop `serversync-velocity.jar` file in your Velocity plugins folder.
2. Start the server to generate configuration file, it will be located in `plugins/serversync/config.toml`
3. Stop the server.
4. Go to ServerSync configuration file and configure message broker credentials.
5. Once you finish, start your server again and congratulations! you finished configuring it in proxy side.
### For Spigot
1. Drop `serversync-spigot.jar` file in your Spigot plugins folder.
2. Start the server to generate configuration file, it will be located in `plugins/ServerSync/config.yml`
3. Stop the server.
4. Go to ServerSync configuration file and configure message broker credentials.
5. Configure your spigot server's name in `server-name` section, this will be used to connect into your spigot server
through proxy.
6. Once you finish, start your spigot server and connect into it from proxy `/server <server name>`. That's all!
